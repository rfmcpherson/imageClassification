Torch scripts for classification. I was running most of the training using
Condor, so you might see a lot of references to that in here. I think this code
is the most up to date, but there might be a few bugs if I forgot to check in
some changes from the machines I was running them on. The scripts might be using
different neural nets than those we had in the paper, but it should be
relatively easy to change them to match the paper's versions. Even if they are
different, the results should be in the same ball park as the ones in the paper.

You will have to download the image libraries seperately.
